# Logistic Regression Tutorial

This module is part of the **ML Playground Starter** repository and provides a complete, hands-on tutorial on **Logistic Regression**.

It includes both an interactive Jupyter notebook and a Python CLI script, covering theory, implementation, evaluation, and advanced topics.

## 📂 Contents

- `logistic_regression_complete_tutorial.ipynb`  
  Step-by-step Jupyter notebook tutorial with math, from-scratch NumPy implementation, scikit-learn pipelines, visualizations, and exercises.

- `main.py`  
  Full Python script version of the tutorial. Can be run end-to-end or in parts via CLI flags.

- `outputs/`  
  Directory where generated plots (ROC, PR, decision boundaries, calibration, etc.) and trained models are saved.
