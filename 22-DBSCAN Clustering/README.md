# DBSCAN Clustering ‚Äî Theory, Implementation, and Visualization

This repository contains a **complete educational implementation** and demonstration of the **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** algorithm.

It includes both a **Jupyter Notebook** (`DBSCAN_Clustering.ipynb`) and a **Python script** (`DBSCAN_main.py`) version for experimentation, visualization, and parameter exploration.

---

## üìò Overview

DBSCAN is a **density-based clustering** algorithm that groups together closely packed points and labels low-density points as **outliers**. Unlike k-means, it does **not require predefining the number of clusters**, and it can discover **arbitrarily shaped clusters**.

This project includes:

- Full conceptual overview of DBSCAN (intuitive explanation).
- A **from-scratch educational implementation** using pure NumPy (O(n¬≤)).
- The **scikit-learn optimized version** with visual demos.
- Tools for **parameter selection** (`eps` and `min_samples`).
- Grid search for sensitivity analysis.
- Visualizations on multiple synthetic datasets (moons, circles, blobs).
- Example of using **different distance metrics** (Euclidean, cosine).

## üß† Features

### 1. Educational Na√Øve Implementation
A fully commented O(n¬≤) implementation of DBSCAN from scratch using pairwise distances.  
Best for understanding algorithmic steps ‚Äî not for production-scale data.

### 2. Scikit-Learn Implementation
Demonstrates usage of `sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN` with real-world parameter tuning and visualization.

### 3. Parameter Selection Tools
Includes utilities to compute **k-distance plots** and perform **grid searches** over parameter values to understand sensitivity to `eps` and `min_samples`.

### 4. Multiple Synthetic Datasets
Visual experiments on:
- Two-moons dataset
- Concentric circles
- Blobs with noise
- Custom 5D blobs (cosine metric)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Run the Notebook
1. Open `DBSCAN_Clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Execute each cell sequentially to explore the implementation interactively.

### Run the Python Script
```bash
python DBSCAN_main.py
```
The script automatically runs all demonstrations and plots results interactively.

---

## üìà Example Output

The notebook and script generate the following visualizations:

- DBSCAN clustering results on various datasets.
- k-distance elbow plots for parameter tuning.
- Scatter plots with noise and cluster labeling.
- Printed grid search table for silhouette scores (ignoring noise).

## üßÆ Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

All examples run on standard Python 3.8+ environments.

---

## üí° Notes & Tips

- **Scaling matters** ‚Äî always normalize or standardize input features before clustering.
- Use **k-distance plots** to choose `eps` intelligently.
- **Increasing `min_samples`** creates stricter density requirements ‚Üí fewer clusters and more noise.
- For **datasets with varying density**, consider **HDBSCAN** (a hierarchical extension).
