# 🧠 ML Playground Starter

A **hands-on collection of minimal, self-contained machine learning projects** — each designed to **help you master ML concepts by building**.  
Every project lives in its own directory and includes:

- 📘 **Jupyter Notebook** → explanations, math, and visualizations  
- 🐍 **Python Script (`main.py`)** → clean executable version  
- 📝 **Mini README** → usage, theory, and notes  

This repository is meant to grow into your **personal ML cookbook**, perfect for **daily or weekly practice**.

## 📂 Project Structure

### Example: `01-Linear-Regression`

**Includes:**
- Implementation from scratch  
- Helper tools and data visualization  
- Well-documented code with explanations  

**Files:**
- `linear_regression.ipynb` → tutorial notebook  
- `main.py` → clean script version  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seyed-mohammadreza-mousavi/ml-playground-starter.git
cd ml-playground-starter
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
For now, you’ll need:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### 3️⃣ Run a Project
Example: **Linear Regression**
```bash
cd 01-linear-regression
python main.py
```

Or open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab:
```bash
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb
```
