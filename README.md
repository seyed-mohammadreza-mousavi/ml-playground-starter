# 🧪 ML Playground Starter

A collection of **simple, self-contained machine learning projects**.  
Each project lives in its own folder and includes:  
- 📓 A Jupyter Notebook (explanations, math, visualizations)  
- 🐍 A Python script (`main.py`) for clean execution  
- 📝 A mini README with usage and theory  

The goal is to **learn by building small projects daily/weekly** and create a personal ML cookbook.

## 📂 Projects

### 01. Linear Regression
- **Folder**:e.g [01-Project-name](01-linear-regression)  
- **What’s inside**:  
  - Implementation from scratch  
  - tools  
  - Visualization of implementation  
- **Files**:  
  - `project_name.ipynb` → tutorial notebook  
  - `main.py` → clean script version

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/seyed-mohammadreza-mousavi/ml-playground-starter.git
cd ml-playground-starter
```
### 2. Set up environment
Install dependencies:

(For now: numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

3. Run a project

Example: Linear Regression
```
cd 01-linear-regression
python main.py
```

Or open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab:
```
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb
```
